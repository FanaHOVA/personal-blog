Ran into this error when doing `reify` on a papertrail version. Couldn't easily find a solution online, so thought I'd post it for future reference. Just add this to your `application.rb`:

`﻿config.active_record.yaml_column_permitted_classes = [ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone, ActiveSupport::TimeZone, Time, Date]`﻿
