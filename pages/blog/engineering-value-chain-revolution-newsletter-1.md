Every company is going to be a software company, but while a century passed between the first and second industrial revolutions, the way software is built and maintained changes much faster. The landscape for developer tools, infrastructure software, and security is ever-changing.

Iâ€™ve got the privilege of meeting many founders building in these categories over the years, learning a lot along the way. My goal with this [Substack](https://evcrevolution.com/) is to share some of those learnings, as well as highlighting startups trying to solve them.

Given the topics, most of the content will be technical in nature, with some more high-level commentary. You will probably find it interesting if you are:

* A software engineer or technologist who is interested in learning about new tools to build with.
* A founder / CTO who wants to learn more about how other companies are making their engineers more productive, and infrastructures more robust.
* An investor trying to learn more about the market.
