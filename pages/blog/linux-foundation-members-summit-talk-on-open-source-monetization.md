Over the years, I've met with many founders building open source companies over the last few years. I was invited to give a talk about open source monetization at the Linux Foundation Members summit, and put together some slides to talk about some of the history of OSS licensing, as well as the "Monetization Helix" framework that I use to think about these products. 

I've made the slides available [on GitHub](https://github.com/FanaHOVA/monetizing-oss-slides), as well as a recording of the first time I gave the talk (which is now much more polished, but lives offline sadly!). If you are building something in this space, feel free to drop me a note, always happy to chat!
