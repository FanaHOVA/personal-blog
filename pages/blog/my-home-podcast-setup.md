I co-host the [Latent Space podcast](https://www.latent.space/), which we mostly record in a irl studio but occasionally do remote episodes. This is the latest [remote episode](https://www.latent.space/p/llms-everywhere#details) we have done, to get a sample. Audio post-prod is done by our audio producer.

For the audio part:

Equipment:
- [Audio-Technica ATR2100x](https://amzn.to/46iym79)
- [InnoGear Microphone Arm Stand](https://amzn.to/3RaiO0J)
- [Microphone windscreen](https://amzn.to/3PtofXx)

Software:
- [Riverside.fm](https://riverside.fm/)
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for simple trimming
- [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) for word-by-word editing
- [smol-podcaster](https://github.com/fanahova/smol-podcaster) for transcription, etc.

I don't really have much to complain about here, and not sure what I'd improve.

For video:
- [Logitech Brio 4K](https://amzn.to/45ZY9AF): I'd update to a DSLR if I wanted to invest in better quality, but this does the job. Just make sure to turn LogiTune on to up it to 2k. 4k is too laggy for calls / live recordings.
- [Elgato Key Light Air](https://amzn.to/3Z7sifd): this is my main light. I have two fill lights to my right to even out lightning.

I haven't really invested in this outside of just having a Zoom setup, so if you're planning to do a lot of YouTube your mileage will likely vary!
