title: LLMs for Developers

I've been thinking about different applications of large language models in developer workflows outside of code creation. I wrote down 3 main ideas [in my newsletter](https://evcrevolution.com/p/evc-10-llm-for-developers), but this is the TL;DR for this blog:

- The future of DSLs üíª The reason why we don't have more domain-specific languages is that it's hard to get adoption and grow a community for them. If every developer in the world could now translate their code to use it, what would that enable?

- LLMs as "Reviewer Zero" üîé A language model can be a great rubber duck, and it can also generate tests for you. Can we scale senior developers' time (and open source maintainers) time by adding a first layer of automated testing + code review powered by a LLM?

- Docs generation for open source ‚úçÔ∏è LLMs are good at summarizing non-ambiguous information provided to them. Every open source project could have all their docs and readmes automatically generated by a model, saving maintainers a lot of time.
