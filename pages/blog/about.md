I was born and raised in Rome, but now live in San Francisco. I'm a Partner at [Decibel](https://decibel.vc), where I invest in infrastructure software, security, and dev tools, as well as leading the development of our internal software platform. In my spare time, I play soccer, Magic The Gathering, along with some FPS games.  

I also run a newsletter focused called [The Engineering Value Chain Revolution](http://engineeringvaluechain.substack.com), which focuses on nascent developer tooling and software architectures. I post that on maker time, as Paul Graham would say, so no set schedule for it.
