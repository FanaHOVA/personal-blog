Built a very simple OpenSea exporter. Put your wallet address and it will return:

- A list of all items you own with traits, collection info, and last sale 

- A separate file with info on all collections you own such as 1/7/30 days sale price, # of owners, etc.

Will make it better over time hopefully :)
